<h1> Vegetarian Challenge Game
  </h1>
  <p><b>Picking food as a vegeterian is hard!</b> You cannot just grab anything you want, each choice needs to be thoughful. Therefore, it takes super long to order and becomes stressfull especially if people aare waiting for you. </p>
  
  <p><b>This game is to develop empathy for this issue.</b> The player is presented random food options and they try to choose a vegeterian full mean. If a choice is not vegeterian, oops, you need to start over. </p>
  
  <h3>Development</h3>
  <p> <b>In progress: </b> Working on the scoreboard, writing my own backend. </p>
