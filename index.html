        <p>Hi! My name is Mina. I have special dietery restrictions which I don't eat meat when I eat out.</p>
        <p>As a vegeterian, it is very hard to go out to eat with friends because it takes me super long to order, I
            never can understand what is vegeterian and what is not just from their names.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Help me chose my dish as quickly as possible in this challenge by chosing the choices that are vegeterian!</h3>
